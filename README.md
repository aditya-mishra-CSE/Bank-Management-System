üöÄ Bank Management SystemüöÄ

I'm excited to share my latest project: a Bank Management System built with Java Swing and MySQL. This application replicates real-world banking operations, including account creation, deposit/withdrawal, PIN changes, and more.

üåü Key Features:
‚úîÔ∏è Secure login with PIN authentication.
‚úîÔ∏è User-friendly interface with multi-step account creation forms.
‚úîÔ∏è Core ATM functionalities seamlessly integrated.

This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply object-oriented principles and delve deeper into database management with MySQL.
